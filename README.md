MicroKey is an open-source, microservices-based application that integrates a Django backend with a Golang Gin service, providing a seamless and scalable architecture for authentication and API management.

## Microservices Architecture

<img src="/api/placeholder/700/350" alt="Microservices Architecture Diagram" />

MicroKey leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility:

1. **Django Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and management.
2. **Golang Gin API Service**: Provides lightweight, high-performance API endpoints.
